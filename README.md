# power-server

This project is meant to provide a REST endpoint streaming power consumption, inspired
by [JoularJX](https://github.com/joular/joularjx) but focusing on exposing power information and metadata over REST
without further processing.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.
